checking gitfetch with creating new file prev file info is not avail by git fetch cmd
when we want to use git fetch need to use git rebase cmd also

checking push cmd after changes in remote

without pull or fetch cmd we cant push getting below error

 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/sagardharmarajula/Test2.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
